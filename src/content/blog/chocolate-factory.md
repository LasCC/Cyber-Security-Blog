Nice, we can see that there is a lot of ports open in that room, let's in the FTP with the anonymous login to see if there is something hidden in there üëÄ

Well, as you can see there is a jpg file in the FTP server let's see if there is some kind of password in there.

Well, I think this is a rabbit hole, let's continue with the website.

```
TryHackMe/chocolate_factory ¬ª gobuster -u http://10.10.239.0/ -w /opt/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x php
```

```
Gobuster v1.3                OJ Reeves (@TheColonial)
=====================================================
[+] Mode         : dir
[+] Url/Domain   : http://10.10.239.0/

[+] Extensions   : .php
=====================================================
/home.php (Status: 200)
```

With the `-x php` we can tell at gobuster that we want only the .php extension and as you can see it worked!

And of-course the only input contain an RCE üëç

Let's create a reverse shell on the remote server.

#AD this is actually my own chrome extension to generate reverse-shells and many more cool things üòé

![https://i.imgur.com/IQ2eaE3.png](https://i.imgur.com/IQ2eaE3.png)

And voil√†! we have a reverse shell üôå

# Enter the key you found!

# What is Charlie's password?

```
cn7824
```

![https://i.imgur.com/3o4JOjA.png](https://i.imgur.com/3o4JOjA.png)

# Enter the user flag

Unfortunately with the basic reverse shell I cannot su to the Charlie's account so I looked on the `/home/charlie` folder and i found a private SSH key

![https://i.imgur.com/5qcdkLc.png](https://i.imgur.com/5qcdkLc.png)

And there you go! We have the access to the Charlie's account! 

```
chmod 600 [id_rsa]
ssh -i id_rsa charlie@[ip]
```

```
# Please reproduce the challenge its not that hard üëÄ
flag{cd*********************d2e}
```

# Enter the root flag

As you can see charlie can use sudo with VI let's see if there is a privesc in gtfobin ü•¥
