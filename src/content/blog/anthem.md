This task involves you, paying attention to details and finding the 'keys to the castle'.

This room is designed for beginners, however, everyone is welcomed to try it out!

Enjoy the Anthem.

In this room, you don't need to brute force any login page. Just your preferred browser and Remote Desktop.

### #1 Let's run nmap and check what ports are open.

```

Let's get into the box using the intel we gathered.

### #1 Let's figure out the username and password to log in to the box.(The box is not on a domain)

```
No awnser is needed
```

### #2 Gain initial access to the machine, what is the contents of user.txt?

Let's use remmina desktop and connect to the VM

![](https://imgur.com/fYSDTzv.png)

```
login : SG
password : UmbracoIsTheBest!
```

![](https://imgur.com/i2RqrfL.png)

```
THM{N00T_NO0T}
```

### #3 Can we spot the admin password?

```
I tried this
dir *.txt /s /p
But nothing came out sadly.. :(
```

Let's try something else..

This one is a little bit tricky but very simple to execute.

First step :

Show all the hidden files

![](https://imgur.com/q7LCXUf.png)

Second step :

Go to the C: Drive and as you can see there is a backup hidden folder

Right click on it and go to the proprieties uncheck the "hidden" square

![](https://imgur.com/Y9ojzwm.png)

Third and final step :

Add SG (the user) to have the permission to see the file

Right click → Security tab → Advanced → Add

![](https://imgur.com/tJWUQxo.png)

And finally click on the Check Names button and then allow all permissions to the file

```

### #4 Escalate your privileges to root, what is the contents of root.txt?

You have two possibilities here..

You can relaunch the remmina app and log with the Administrator account

Or you can stay with the SG's account and go to the following path

```
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop
```

The Administrator's password is :

```
