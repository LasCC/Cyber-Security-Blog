➜  TryHackMe cat .other_user
Slade Wilson was 16 years old when he enlisted in the United States Army, having lied about his age. After serving a stint in Korea, he was later assigned to Camp Washington where he had been promoted to the rank of major. In the early 1960s, he met Captain Adeline Kane, who was tasked with training young soldiers in new fighting techniques in anticipation of brewing troubles taking place in Vietnam. Kane was amazed at how skilled Slade was and how quickly he adapted to modern conventions of warfare. She immediately fell in love with him and realized that he was without a doubt the most able-bodied combatant that she had ever encountered. She offered to privately train Slade in guerrilla warfare. In less than a year, Slade mastered every fighting form presented to him and was soon promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. Six months later, Adeline and he were married and she became pregnant with their first child. The war in Vietnam began to escalate and Slade was shipped overseas. In the war, his unit massacred a village, an event which sickened him. He was also rescued by SAS member Wintergreen, to whom he would later return the favor.

Chosen for a secret experiment, the Army imbued him with enhanced physical powers in an attempt to create metahuman super-soldiers for the U.S. military. Deathstroke became a mercenary soon after the experiment when he defied orders and rescued his friend Wintergreen, who had been sent on a suicide mission by a commanding officer with a grudge.[7] However, Slade kept this career secret from his family, even though his wife was an expert military combat instructor.

A criminal named the Jackal took his younger son Joseph Wilson hostage to force Slade to divulge the name of a client who had hired him as an assassin. Slade refused, claiming it was against his personal honor code. He attacked and killed the kidnappers at the rendezvous. Unfortunately, Joseph's throat was slashed by one of the criminals before Slade could prevent it, destroying Joseph's vocal cords and rendering him mute.

After taking Joseph to the hospital, Adeline was enraged at his endangerment of her son and tried to kill Slade by shooting him, but only managed to destroy his right eye. Afterwards, his confidence in his physical abilities was such that he made no secret of his impaired vision, marked by his mask which has a black, featureless half covering his lost right eye. Without his mask, Slade wears an eyepatch to cover his eye.

Nothing very interesting there let's see if there is some stenography in those files.

After some time I used the tool called "Stegcracker" and it worked !

[Paradoxis/StegCracker](https://github.com/Paradoxis/StegCracker)

```

The password for the aa.jpg is password let's steghide extract now :D

```
➜  TryHackMe steghide extract -sf aa.jpg

This is your visa to Land on Lian_Yu
# Just for Fun ***

a small Note about it

Having spent years on the island, Oliver learned how to be resourceful and
set booby traps all over the island in the common event he ran into dangerous
people. The island is also home to many animals, including pheasants,
wild pigs and wolves.

➜  TryHackMe cat shado
M3tahuman
```

### #5 What is the file name with SSH password?

```
The file of the ssh password is the file we extract on the aa.jpg
"shado"
```

### #6 User.txt

Let's connect on the machine using the credentials that we extracted.

```
The username is Slade the username is the first username on the .other_user
on the ftp that we downloaded earlier
```

```
Creds :
slade:M3tahuman
```

```
slade@LianYu:~$ ls
